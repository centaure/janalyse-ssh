JANALYSE-SSH

TODO : 
  => Add tests with a remote host, in addition to localhost
  => "ls --format=single-column" may to be replaced by "ls | cat"
  => Check if "date '+%y%m%d_%H%M%S'" is supported on all *nix

CAVEATS : 
  => ssh shell operations must be executed with the same thread, 
     do not span a shell session across several threads
     So be carefull when using REPL, as each "evaluation" is done with a new thread ! 

------------------------------------------------------------------
0.8.0
 - now using sbt 0.11.3
 - now using sbt-assembly 0.8.1
 - now using sbteclipse 2.1.0-RC1
 - Set of new method to help with commons remote commands :
   fileSize, md5sum, uname, ls, pwd, cd(*), hostname, date, findAfterDate
   (*) of course only for shell sessions 
 - JSCH updated to 0.1.48
 - md5sum method added to SSHTools object
 - manage well connect timeout (default = 30s) and general socket timeout (default = 5mn)
   => When using REPL, this general socket timeout must be raised to a higher value

------------------------------------------------------------------
0.7.4 
 - SSHPassword toString method added (return the password)
 - updated for scala 2.9.2 support
 - scalatest 1.7.2
 - no more support for scala 2.8.1 & 2.8.2


------------------------------------------------------------------
0.7.3
 - JCSH updated to release 0.1.47
 - SSHOptions now contains an extra field "name" which allow user to friendly identify a remote ssh system
 - SSHOptions password type is now of SSHPassword type instead of String.
   Implicit conversions is provided from String, Option[String]
 - SSHShell batch method renamed to execute


------------------------------------------------------------------
0.7.2
 - added a package object jassh to define shortcuts to fr.janalyse.ssh.SSH class and object
 - SSHOptions, host parameter is now in first position !


------------------------------------------------------------------
0.7.1
 - fix big issue with SSHShell results separator process. => not seen using localhost tests => Must add remote tests !!


------------------------------------------------------------------
0.7.0
 - Added new method to SSH : newShell & newSftp for user to manage themselves shell and sftp session
 - Some internal changes to SSHExec class, in order to try to remove actor dependency. Mixing actors systems looks problematic
 - SSHShell new implementation, no more actors used, better performances and behavior, ... (throughput : 504 cmd/s using persistency)
 - SSHExec last result line is no longer lost
 - SSHOptions : new parameter : "prompt" to enable custom shell or console command to be use.
                prompt provide to SSHShell the way to separate command results
 - SSHOptions : connectionTimeout renamed into timeout
 - Various cleanup and enhancements
 - Tests : compare performances persistent SSHShell versus SSHExec  commands throughputs
 - SSH : Add an execute immediate method which rely on SSHExec, not SSHShell ! (throughput : 62cmd/s) 
         execOnce & execOnceAndTrim
 - SSHExec : Do not rely on DaemonActor/Actor anymore
 - SSHShell : Removed init Thread.sleep => Better performances (throughput : 37 cmd/s instead 1cmd/s)
 - SSH.connect becomes SSH.once
 - Removing apply in SSH class as it may encourage bad usage, and close not called

 
------------------------------------------------------------------
0.6.0
 - update jsch to 0.1.46
 - update sbteclipse plugin to 2.0.0
 - update sbtassembly plugin to 0.7.3
 - background ssh execution API changes (run method)
 - temporary hack to remove CPU overhead within run method
