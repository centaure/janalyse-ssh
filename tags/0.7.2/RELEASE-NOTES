TODO : Add tests with a remote host, in addition to localhost 


0.7.2
 - added a package object jassh to define shortcuts to fr.janalyse.ssh.SSH class and object
 - SSHOptions, host parameter is now in first position !


0.7.1

0.7.0
 - Added new method to SSH : newShell & newSftp for user to manage themselves shell and sftp session

 - SSHExec last result line is no longer lost
 - SSHOptions : new parameter : "prompt" to enable custom shell or console command to be use.
                prompt provide to SSHShell the way to separate command results
 - SSHOptions : connectionTimeout renamed into timeout
 - Various cleanup and enhancements
 - Tests : compare performances persistent SSHShell versus SSHExec  commands throughputs
 - SSH : Add an execute immediate method which rely on SSHExec, not SSHShell ! (throughput : 62cmd/s) 
         execOnce & execOnceAndTrim
 - SSHExec : Do not rely on DaemonActor/Actor anymore
 - SSHShell : Removed init Thread.sleep => Better performances (throughput : 37 cmd/s instead 1cmd/s)
 - SSH.connect becomes SSH.once
 - Removing apply in SSH class as it may encourage bad usage, and close not called

 
0.6.0
 - update jsch to 0.1.46
